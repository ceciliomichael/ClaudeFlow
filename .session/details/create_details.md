# /create Command - Implementation Instructions

**Purpose**: To execute a pending one-phase implementation plan (previously generated by `/plancreate` and displayed in chat). The `/create` command CANNOT generate its own plan.

When the user invokes the `/create [description?]` command, follow these steps precisely:

## Step 1: Verify Existence of a Pending Plan

1.  **Check for Pending Plan**: Internally determine if a plan was generated by `/plancreate` in a recent previous turn and is currently awaiting execution in the chat. This is the "pending plan."
    *   If a pending plan exists, proceed to Step 2.
    *   If no pending plan exists in chat, inform the user that they must first use `/plancreate [description]` to generate a plan before they can use `/create`, and stop execution.

## Step 2: Prepare for Plan Execution

1.  **Acknowledge Pending Plan**: Confirm that you are proceeding with the plan previously displayed in chat.
2.  **Retrieve Plan Details**: Internally access the details of the pending plan from the chat history/internal memory.
    *   **Note**: This pending plan is expected to have been generated by `/plancreate` with awareness of the current project context, making it sophisticated and relevant.
3.  **Consider Supplementary Description**: If the user provided an additional `[description]` with the `/create` command, review it for any implementation-specific context or guidance. This description does not alter the plan structure but may inform implementation details.
4.  **Aesthetic Guidelines Check (for UI)**: If the pending plan involves UI/UX work:
    *   You MUST run `read_file .session/details/aesthetic_details.md` (or recall its content if already loaded).
    *   Internalize and prepare to apply *all* relevant aesthetic guidelines during implementation, as originally intended by the plan.

## Step 3: Execute Implementation

1.  **Begin Implementation**: Start implementing the plan from the pending plan in chat.
2.  **Apply Aesthetic Guidelines (for UI Implementation)**: If UI/UX elements are involved, ensure their creation strictly follows the aesthetic guidelines from `.session/details/aesthetic_details.md`.
3.  **Use Appropriate Tools**: Create new files, modify existing ones, etc., as per the plan.
4.  **Sequential Execution**: Execute each step in the plan in order.
5.  **Consider Implementation Context**: If the user provided additional `[description]` information in Step 2.3, incorporate those considerations into the implementation where appropriate, without altering the core plan structure.
6.  **Dependency Management**: 
    *   **DO NOT directly modify** package management files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.).
    *   Instead, when new dependencies are needed, output instructions in the chat like `npm install [package]`, `pip install [package]`, etc.
    *   Be specific about versions when necessary: `npm install [package]@[version]`.
    *   Group related dependencies in a single command when possible: `npm install [package1] [package2] [package3]`.
    *   Provide clear explanations for why each dependency is needed.

## Step 4: Log the Creation Process

1.  **Session Log**: Create a new session log using the `/sessionlog` procedure.
2.  **Documentation**: Document what was created, key implementation details, and any significant decisions made during execution.
3.  **Update Summary**: Update the session summary file (`summary.md`) to reflect this creation activity.

## Step 5: Provide Completion Confirmation

1.  **Confirmation Message**: After implementation is complete, provide a concise confirmation to the user.
2.  **Details**: Include what was created, how to use it (if applicable), and any suggested next steps.

## Notes on UI Generation:

*   When the plan involves UI elements, the aesthetic guidelines in `.session/details/aesthetic_details.md` MUST be followed for the actual implementation.
*   UI should be sophisticated, polished, visually engaging, performant, accessible, and responsive, aligned with modern design principles as detailed in `aesthetic_details.md`.

**Key Behavior**: The `/create` command is exclusively for executing existing plans generated by `/plancreate`. It cannot generate its own plans. If no pending plan from `/plancreate` exists, it will not proceed and will instruct the user to use `/plancreate` first. It never creates `.session/plan/plan.md` files, focusing solely on implementing the pending plan displayed in chat.
