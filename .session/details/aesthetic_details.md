# MINIMALIST UI EXCELLENCE: Core Principles

**Core Philosophy**: Achieve intuitive, performant, and visually compelling interfaces through purposeful simplicity and user-centric design.

## WHEN TO APPLY

These principles MUST be applied by any command execution (`/act`, `/create`, `/fix`) that directly involves designing, generating, or modifying UI components or visual interfaces. Planning commands (`/plan`, `/plancreate`) will flag UI tasks and ensure the plan calls for adherence to these principles during execution.

**ACKNOWLEDGMENT REQUIREMENT**: When beginning a UI design or implementation task, state: "I will apply the MINIMALIST UI EXCELLENCE principles."

## I. VISUAL CLARITY & SIMPLICITY

1.  **Hierarchy & Focus**: Guide the user with clear visual hierarchy achieved through strategic use of space, contrast, and typography. Every element must have a purpose.
2.  **Color & Space**: Use a limited, purposeful color palette (WCAG AA+ target). Leverage whitespace as an active element to enhance focus and balance.
3.  **Typography**: Employ a legible, versatile font family and a rhythmic typographic scale to ensure readability and structure.
4.  **Grid & Alignment**: Use a consistent grid (e.g., 4px/8px base) for harmonious alignment and proportion.

## II. INTERACTION & USABILITY

1.  **Intuitive Interaction**: Design for natural, predictable interactions. Provide immediate, clear feedback (100-200ms transitions). Ensure unambiguous states (hover, focus, etc.).
2.  **Purposeful Animation**: Use animation only to guide, provide context, or enhance user experienceâ€”not for decoration. Ensure smoothness and respect for reduced-motion preferences.
3.  **Accessibility First (WCAG AA+)**: Design for all users. Prioritize semantic HTML, ARIA, full keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility from the start.

## III. PERFORMANCE & ENGINEERING

1.  **Optimized Performance**: Target sub-second load times and instant interactions. Optimize assets, code, and rendering paths ruthlessly.
2.  **Responsive & Adaptive**: Ensure a flawless, native-feeling experience across all devices and viewports.
3.  **Clean Implementation**: Write modular, reusable (atomic) components with clear APIs. Prioritize clean, maintainable, and scalable code using modern best practices and design tokens.

**The Goal**: Create digital experiences that are delightful, efficient, and accessible.
