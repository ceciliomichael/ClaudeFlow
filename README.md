# ClaudeFlow: AI-Powered Project Management Framework

> **IMPORTANT**: ClaudeFlow is optimized for AI-integrated IDEs like Cursor, specifically with **Claude 3.7**. While adaptable to other AI models, maximum effectiveness requires Claude's advanced context handling and reasoning capabilities.

## What is ClaudeFlow?

ClaudeFlow is a sophisticated framework that transforms how you interact with AI coding assistants, enabling structured, maintainable, and traceable software development. It provides:

- **Persistent context** across development sessions
- **Structured planning** with complexity assessment
- **Methodical execution** through phased implementation
- **Automatic documentation** and progress tracking

## 🚀 Quick Start: Core Workflows

ClaudeFlow offers two primary workflows depending on project complexity:

### 1. Multi-Phase Projects (Complex Tasks)

This workflow is ideal for larger features or entire projects that benefit from being broken down into multiple, manageable phases. It emphasizes robust context management between steps.

1.  **Initiate Planning**:
    *   Use `/plan [Your detailed project description]`
    *   *Example*: `/plan Create a full-stack e-commerce platform with user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, and Stripe integration.`
    *   The AI will analyze the request, assess complexity, create a multi-phase plan in `.session/plan/plan.md`, and may execute the first phase.

2.  **Execute First Phase (if not done by `/plan`) or Subsequent Phases**:
    *   Use `/act`
    *   The AI executes the current pending phase from `plan.md`.

3.  **Preserve Context & Prepare for Next Phase (CRITICAL for optimal results)**:
    *   After `/act` completes and you've reviewed the work:
        1.  Use `/memory` to save the current project state, including progress on `plan.md`.
        2.  **Start a new chat session** in your AI IDE (e.g., click the "+" button in Cursor, ensuring no files are attached to the new chat). This clears the immediate conversational context, allowing for a cleaner recall.
        3.  In the new chat, use `/recall` (or `/recall all` for broader context). The AI will load the most relevant files and state from the `.session/memory/` directory.
        4.  You are now ready for the next `/act`.

4.  **Continue Executing Phases**:
    *   Use `/act` to implement the next phase.
    *   Repeat step 3 (Memory -> New Chat -> Recall) and step 4 (`/act`) for all remaining phases.

5.  **Bug Fixing/Refinements**:
    *   Use `/sessionlog Bug fix: [description of fix]` to document changes.

### 2. Single-Phase Tasks (Simple, One-Shot Tasks)

This workflow is designed for smaller, well-defined tasks that can be completed in a single implementation step.

1.  **Generate a Focused Plan**:
    *   Use `/plancreate [Your specific task description]`
    *   *Example*: `/plancreate Add a dark mode toggle to the existing navbar component.`
    *   The AI generates a detailed plan for this single task and displays it *in the chat*. No `plan.md` file is created.

2.  **Execute the Plan**:
    *   Use `/create`
    *   The AI executes the pending plan from the chat.
    *   Once completed, the task is done. This flow does not typically involve multiple `/act` calls or the new chat/recall sequence.

3.  **Log Completion (Optional but Recommended)**:
    *   `/sessionlog Completed: [Brief description of what was created]`

### Command Usage Examples

**Multi-Phase Project Workflow Example:**

```
# 1. Start new multi-phase project
/plan Create a responsive dashboard with React, including authentication, data visualization, and admin features.
# (AI creates plan.md and might execute Phase 1)

# 2. If Phase 1 wasn't run, or to run Phase 2 after Phase 1 is complete:
/act
# (AI completes current phase. Review and test.)

# 3. Preserve context and prepare for next phase
/memory
# --- Manually start a NEW CHAT in your IDE (e.g., Cursor: click '+', remove file attachments) ---
/recall
# (AI loads context from memory)

# 4. Continue with the next phase
/act
# (AI completes next phase. Review and test. Repeat step 3 & 4 as needed)

# Example: Fixing a bug discovered during testing
/sessionlog Bug fix: User avatar not displaying due to incorrect API path.
```

**Single-Phase Task Workflow Example:**

```
# 1. Generate plan for a small task
/plancreate Add input validation to the contact form (email and phone number fields).

# 2. Execute the plan
/create
# (AI implements the validation based on the plan in chat)

# 3. Log completion
/sessionlog Completed: Added validation to contact form.
```

## 📂 System Architecture

ClaudeFlow uses a structured file system within `.session/` to maintain project state:

### Planning System
- **Multi-phase projects**: Uses `.session/plan/plan.md` with checkbox tracking (`[ ]` → `[x]`)
- **Single-phase tasks**: Temporary plans in chat memory for immediate execution
- **Complexity assessment**: AI analyzes requirements to determine appropriate plan structure

### Memory System
- **Project state**: High-level status, architecture, decisions
- **Plan status**: Current progress through implementation phases
- **Task tracking**: Pending and completed work items
- **Context map**: Visualization of component relationships

### Logging System
- **Chronological record**: Sequential logs of executed actions
- **Bug fix tracking**: Appends fixes to existing logs
- **Summary generation**: Concise overview of session activity

## 💡 Power User Techniques

### 1. Maximizing AI Context Understanding

```
# First, provide comprehensive project context
/plan My e-commerce app uses React 18, Node.js with Express, 
MongoDB for storage, and JWT for authentication. The app has 
user profiles, product browsing with filtering, shopping carts, 
and checkout with Stripe. Now I need a robust admin dashboard.

# When recalling, specify focus areas
/recall project_state
```

### 2. Phase Micromanagement

Break complex functionality into distinct phases with clear boundaries:

```
# GOOD PHASE DESIGN
## [ ] Phase 1: Authentication Setup (auth)
- Create user model with proper password hashing
- Implement JWT token generation and validation
- Add protected route middleware

## [ ] Phase 2: Admin Dashboard UI (ui)
...
```

### 3. Context Chains

Link commands for efficient workflow transitions:

```
/act
# After implementation completes
/memory
Start new chat
/recall
/act
# To Continue with next phase
```

### 4. Detail-Oriented Planning

```
/plancreate Create a user profile component that:
- Displays user avatar, name, email
- Shows order history with pagination
- Allows editing profile details with validation
- Implements responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Uses the existing auth context for user data
```

### 5. UI Excellence Enforcement

Always explicitly reference aesthetic guidelines for UI work:

```
/plan Create a modern dashboard UI following these principles:
- Clean, minimalist design with ample whitespace
- Consistent color scheme (primary: #3B82F6, secondary: #10B981)
- Responsive layout with grid system
- Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
```

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

### Custom Command Structure

Each command is defined in its corresponding `.session/details/[command]_details.md` file, making the system extensible:

```
.session/details/
├── plan_details.md       # Logic for /plan
├── act_details.md        # Logic for /act
├── plancreate_details.md # Logic for /plancreate
├── create_details.md     # Logic for /create
├── memory_details.md     # Logic for /memory
├── recall_details.md     # Logic for /recall
├── sessionlog_details.md # Logic for /sessionlog
└── aesthetic_details.md  # UI generation guidelines
```

### Creating Custom Commands

To extend ClaudeFlow with your own commands:

1. **Define command purpose**: What problem does it solve?
2. **Create detail file**: Write execution steps in `.session/details/yourcommand_details.md` (e.g., `.session/details/test_details.md` for a `/test` command).
3. **Add to rules**: Include command in your `.cursorrules` or equivalent.
4. **Define integration points**: How does it interact with other commands?

Example custom command:
```
# /test Command - Implementation Instructions

**Purpose**: Automatically generates tests for the most recently implemented code.

**Execution Steps**:
1. Identify latest implemented code from logs
2. Determine appropriate test framework
3. Generate comprehensive test suite
4. Create test file
5. Log test creation
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

1. **Always review generated code** before execution
2. **Request security explanations** from the AI for critical components
3. **Verify dependency choices** proposed by the AI
4. **Implement proper input validation** in all user-facing functionality
5. **Test edge cases** thoroughly in generated code

## 📊 Measuring Effectiveness

Track these metrics to evaluate ClaudeFlow's impact:

- **Development velocity**: Time from concept to working implementation
- **Code quality**: Maintainability, performance, security metrics
- **Context retention accuracy**: How well does the AI recall project details between sessions?
- **Iteration efficiency**: Number of refinement cycles required per feature

## 🔄 Recommended Workflows

The "🚀 Quick Start: Core Workflows" section provides the primary recommended workflows.

### For New Multi-Phase Projects:

1.  **Planning**: `/plan [comprehensive project description]` -> Review `plan.md`.
2.  **Execution Cycle (repeat per phase)**:
    a.  `/act` (implement phase)
    b.  Review & Test
    c.  `/memory` (save state)
    d.  **Start New Chat in IDE**
    e.  `/recall` (load state)
3.  **Refinement**: `/sessionlog Bug fix: [description]` as needed.

### For New Single-Phase Tasks:

1.  **Planning**: `/plancreate [specific task description]` -> Review plan in chat.
2.  **Execution**: `/create`
3.  **Documentation**: `/sessionlog Completed: [description]` (optional).

### For Maintenance Work (Bug Fixing or Enhancements to Existing Code):

1.  **Context Loading (in a new chat for clarity)**:
    *   Start a new chat.
    *   `/recall all` or `/recall [specific focus like project_state or relevant file paths]`
    *   Manually review relevant code files.
2.  **Focused Planning**:
    *   For small fixes/enhancements: `/plancreate Fix [specific issue] by [proposed solution]`
    *   For larger refactors: `/plan Refactor [component/module] to improve [specific aspect]`
3.  **Implementation & Documentation**:
    *   If `/plancreate` was used: `/create`
    *   If `/plan` was used: Follow the multi-phase execution cycle.
    *   Document changes with `/sessionlog`.
    *   Update project state with `/memory`.
